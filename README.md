## SLQA

Multi-Granularity Hierarchical Attention Fusion Networks
for Reading Comprehension and Question Answering    
If anyone would love to test the performance on SQuAD, please tell me the final score. 
You just need to change the coca_reader.py to read in dataset of SQuAD.

update:
- Rewrite the model using allennlp. It seems that it would run successfully. I'm waiting for the performance. 
- Add simple flow layer and the config file is slqa_h.json in package config.

update 12.6:
- It seems that the performance is not good enough.
