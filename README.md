## SLQA

Multi-Granularity Hierarchical Attention Fusion Networks
for Reading Comprehension and Question Answering    
~~The model has many problems and it can't reach the performance as the leaderboard in my opinion because it's performance on CoQA is bad too, so you can forked the repo as you like but you should know it's bad performance and if you have made it better, please let me know. Thank you!  ~~
~~BTW, waiting for a man to help me !~~
If anyone would love to test the performance on SQuAD, please tell me the final score. You just need to change the coca_reader.py to read in dataset of SQuAD.

update:
- Rewrite the model using allennlp. It seems that it would run successfully. I'm waiting for the performance.
